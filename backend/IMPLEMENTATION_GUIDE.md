## Database Structure

### Collections
1. **admin** - Admin accounts (enhanced with SuperAdmin role)
2. **school** - School registrations and profiles
3. **subscription** - Subscription plans and billing
4. **academicYear** - Academic year templates
5. **systemLog** - Audit trail of all actions
6. **backup** - Backup records and status

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Update index.js to import all models
Ensure all models are imported in your server file or they're auto-loaded when referenced.

### 2. Run backend server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 3. Test SuperAdmin endpoints
Use the provided API documentation with headers:
```
x-admin-id: <superadmin_user_id>
```

### 4. Create first SuperAdmin
Register with role='SuperAdmin' in adminSchema, or update existing admin to SuperAdmin role.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Uses `x-admin-id` header - consider implementing JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for SuperAdmin operations
3. **Encryption**: Password hashing with bcrypt
4. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged in SystemLog
5. **Data Isolation**: Schools isolated from each other
6. **Backup Security**: Encryption support for backups

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
2. **Indexing**: SystemLog and other collection have database indexes
3. **Filtering**: Advanced query filtering for efficient searches
4. **Population**: Strategic use of MongoDB populate for related data

---

## Future Enhancements

1. JWT token-based authentication
2. Two-factor authentication for SuperAdmin
3. Advanced reporting with charts/graphs
4. Scheduled automatic backups
5. Data retention policies
6. Email notifications for critical actions
7. Multi-language support
8. Role-based permissions matrix
9. API rate limiting
10. Webhook support for external systems

---

  "name": "Super Admin",
  "email": "superadmin@system.com",
  "password": "SuperAdmin123",
  "schoolName": "System",
  "role": "SuperAdmin"
}
```

### Test School Creation
```bash
POST /SuperAdmin/School/Create
Header: x-admin-id: <superadmin_id>
Body: {
  "schoolName": "Test School",
  "email": "test@school.com",
  "phone": "0700000000",
  "schoolAdminId": "<admin_id>"
}
```

### Test Subscription Creation
```bash
POST /SuperAdmin/Subscription/Create
Header: x-admin-id: <superadmin_id>
Body: {
  "schoolId": "<school_id>",
  "planName": "Professional",
  "planPrice": 5000,
  ...
}
```

## API Response Structure

All responses follow consistent format:

**Success:**
```json
{
  "message": "Operation description",
  "data": { ... },
  "pagination": { ... }
}
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Error details"
}
```

---

## Environment Variables (Optional)

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@schoolmanagement.com

MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/schoolManagementSystem
PORT=5000
```

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Forbidden: Only Super Admin can access this"
- Ensure `x-admin-id` header is provided
- Verify the admin ID has SuperAdmin role

### Issue: Schools not created
- Verify school admin exists and is approved
- Check for duplicate school names or emails

### Issue: Subscription not showing in school
- Ensure subscription is created before linking
- Verify school ID exists
